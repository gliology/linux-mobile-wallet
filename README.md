__WIP: This is an early, broken and insecure PoC!__ 

A Mobile NixOS based digital wallet to keep your keys safe and airgapped. Currently only targets the Pine64 PinePhone but can be easily extended to any device supported by Mobile NixOS or just NixOS.

For now the main app that does all key management and signing is Stylo running inside waydroid.
